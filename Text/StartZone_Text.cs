Such as \"> go \n<direction>\" (North, South, East or West) to move around. If you’re \never confused about how to proceed, you can always type ‘help’ \ninto the terminal for a list of available commands.\n";
  public const string S_S1_Start_2 = "\"We're about to reach Trash Island!\"  the pilot announces, \"I hope \nyou're as good as they say you are. This won't be easy. But with \nall that trash gathering like this and those monsters appearing, \nsomething bad was bound to happen sooner or later.\"\n\n\"It's currently too dangerous for our cleaning crew to step foot on \nthe island. And even if they could, they wouldn't even know how to \nhandle all that trash. That’s why we need an expert like you, to \nswoop in, eliminate the monsters and figure out a proper way to \nhandle the trash in the process. Then our team can take care of \nthe rest.\"  \n";
  public const string S_S1_Start_3 = "\"See that big Tower to the south? According to our intel, that's \nwhere the one responsible for all this resides. It doesn't matter \nhow many other monsters you defeat, if you don't take care of \nthe one in that tower, more of those things will just appear...\"\n\n“You can't just waltz on in however, the gate is locked and you'll \nneed 4 parts of a key, each held by one of the 4 Trash Guardians.”\n\n“Given that you're the best janitor the UN headquarters had on \nhand, I'm sure it'll be a walk in the park for you. Good luck champ.”\n";
  public const string S_S1_Start_4 = "You land in a big pile of trash, saving both yourself and your \ncleaning cart from a hard landing. The only tools at your disposal \nare the usual cleaning supplies in your cart, as well as a walkie \ntalkie.\n";
  public const string S_S2_1 = "On your way west, you pass by the island docks. The sudden \nsmell of rotting fish hits you like a wave from the north.\n";
