  public const string S_S1_Start_1 = "Welcome to \"Waves of Waste\", a narrative driven adventure game, \nmade by Magnus Lundbech, Mikkel Lindskov Petersen, Nicholas \nHeinrich Schnack, Peter Karlbye Winther, Troels Lindenskov \nMathiesen and Yaroslav Haidash, for our 1st semester project. \n\nIn this game, we use Sustainable Development Goals 14.1: \nReduce marine pollution, as the inspiration for a game where you \nvisit the Great Pacific Garbage Patch — aptly named \"Trash \nIsland\" — to defeat monsters, and learn how to properly handle \nthe different types of trash that make up the island. \n\nThis game is entirely terminal based, which means you type \ncommands into the terminal to make actions. Such as \"> go \n<direction>\" (North, South, East or West) to move around. If you're \never confused about how to proceed, you can always type <help> \ninto the terminal for a list of available commands.\n";
  public const string S_S1_Start_2 = "\"We're about to reach Trash Island!\"  the pilot announces, \"I hope \nyou're as good as they say you are. This won't be easy. But with \nall that trash gathering like this and those monsters appearing, \nsomething bad was bound to happen sooner or later.\"\n\n\"It's currently too dangerous for our cleaning crew to step foot on \nthe island. And even if they could, they wouldn't even know how to \nhandle all that trash. That's why we need an expert like you, to \nswoop in, eliminate the monsters and figure out a proper way to \nhandle the trash in the process. Then our team can take care of \nthe rest.\"  \n";
  public const string S_S1_Start_3 = "\"See that big Tower to the south? According to our intel, that's \nwhere the one responsible for all this resides. It doesn't matter \nhow many other monsters you defeat, if you don't take care of \nthe one in that tower, more of those things will just appear...\"\n\n“You can't just waltz on in however, the gate is locked and you'll \nneed 4 parts of a key, each held by one of the 4 Trash Guardians.”\n\n“Given that you're the best janitor the UN headquarters had on \nhand, I'm sure it'll be a walk in the park for you. Good luck champ.”\n";
  
  // S1 text
  public const string S_S1_Start_4 = "You land in a big pile of trash, saving both yourself and your \ncleaning cart from a hard landing. The only tools at your disposal \nare the usual cleaning supplies in your cart, as well as a walkie \ntalkie.\n";
  
  // S2 text
  public const string S_S2_1 = "On your way west, you pass by the island docks. The sudden \nsmell of rotting fish hits you like a wave from the north.\n";
  
  // S3 text
  public const string S_S3_1 = "As you continue along the road west, you're surprised to find a \nlong line of people in front of you. Looking for where the line starts, \nyou face south, and wonder how someone managed to build an \nentire theme park on the island.\n";
  public const string S_S3_2 = "As you pass the people in line, you notice that they aren't people \nat all. They look like the insides of trash bins that came to life. \nThese monsters resemble large, dull minded tourists, fit with dirty \nclothes and hats. \n";
  
  // S4 text
  public const string S_S4_1 = "You enter a town. Passing buildings made of wet cardboard, \nstreets of broken glass, and a large statue that resembles some \nweird wet creature. \n";
  public const string S_S4_Talk = "Despite not seeing anyone in the vicinity, you try to talk. Suddenly \nyou hear a devilish voice from the statue.\n\nThe statue tells you that a loud commotion has been heard coming \nfrom the mall to the north. He also mentions the police having \ntrouble with a local gang, east of here…\n";
  
  // S5 text
  public const string S_S5_1 = "In front of you stands a large tower. As you walk up to its gate, you \nsee 4 key slots in the door. \n";
  
  // S6 text
  public const string S_S6_1 = "After placing all 4 key pieces in their slots, you hear a loud clicking \nnoise, followed by the gate slowly opening.\n\nInside the tower, you're met with a large set of stairs. \n";
  public const string S_S6_2 = "You're in luck! You find an elevator in a side room, and it's almost \nwhole — if you ignore the missing door, buttons, and the cable \nconnecting it to the top of the tower…\n";
  public const string S_S6_3 = "After spending 30 minutes pushing your cart up the stairs. You \nreach the top room and enter. In front of you sits a large, \nhumanoid creature, made entirely of water…\n\nThe creature announces itself as the Sea Devil — a manifestation \nof the ocean's anger. It wants revenge on those that continue to \npoison it. It formed Trash Island from the garbage humans \ndumped into the sea, and now builds trash monsters to wipe out \nhumanity.";
  public const string S_S6_4 = "> “The Sea Devil creates a large octopus monster, made out of \nwashed up fishing gear and old nets. ";

  public const string S_S6_8 = "With the Sea Devil reduced to not much more than a puddle on \nthe ground, you reach for your walkie talkie, to report your \nsuccess.\n\n“I knew you could do it!”, the pilot yells, unnecessarily loud, “The \ncleaning crews are setting foot on the island as we speak. Ready \nto begin cleaning this whole place up, just as you instructed”.";
  public const string S_S6_9 = "Before leaving you grab the mop from your cleaning cart. And the \nlast thing you see as you sweep up the remnant puddle of the Sea \nDevil, is your own reflection…\n\nThe End\n";
